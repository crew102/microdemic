## Abstract


```r
ma_abstract(query = "Ti='biology'...", count = 3)
#> [1] "This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the incretin peptides glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GIP and GLP-1. GIP and GLP-1 are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet β-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. Incretin-receptor activation leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, induction of β-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GIP also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GLP-1 exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also promotes satiety and sustained GLP-1–receptor activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GIP and GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 has led to the development of degradation-resistant GLP-1–receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of incretin action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
#> [2] "Once a poorly defined pathologic oddity, in recent years, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has emerged as a distinct oncogenetic entity that is now center stage in clinical trials of kinase-targeted therapies. This review charts the rapid progress that has established GIST as a model for understanding the role of oncogenic kinase mutations in human tumorigenesis. Approximately 80% to 85% of GISTs harbor activating mutations of the KIT tyrosine kinase. In a series of 322 GISTs (including 140 previously published cases) studied by the authors in detail, mutations in the KIT gene occurred with decreasing frequency in exons 11 (66.1%), 9 (13%), 13 (1.2%), and 17 (0.6%). In the same series, a subset of tumors had mutations in the KIT-related kinase gene PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which occurred in either exon 18 (5.6%) or 12 (1.5%). The remainder of GISTs (12%) were wild type for both KIT and PDGFRA. Comparative studies of KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant, and wild-type GISTs indicate that there are many simi..."
